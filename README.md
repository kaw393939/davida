## Answer Key

1. Correct Sentence: `My friend and I go to the park every day.`
   - Explanation: The correct form is "My friend and I," not "Me and my friend." The verb should also agree with the plural subject "My friend and I," hence "go" instead of "goes."
2. Correct Sentence: `It's raining outside, and I left my umbrella at home.`
   - Explanation: The contraction "It's" (it is) is appropriate here, not "Its" (possessive form). Also, the word "umbrella" was misspelled, and a comma is needed after "outside" because these are two independent clauses.
3. Correct Sentence: `There are a lot of books on the shelf.`
   - Explanation: When talking about a quantity of items, "there are" should be used, not "their is." "Their" is a possessive pronoun, while "there" is used in this context to introduce the subject of the sentence.
4. Correct Sentence: `I don't like to eat vegetables.`
   - Explanation: The correct form is "I don't" (I do not), not "I doesn't."
5. Correct Sentence: `Who did you say that to?`
   - Explanation: "Who" is the correct word to use here as it's the subject of the clause. "Whom" is typically used as the object of a verb or preposition, but it's not the case here.
6. Correct Sentence: `You were the best player in the game yesterday.`
   - Explanation: The correct past form of "be" after "you" is "were," not "was."
7. Correct Sentence: `She doesn't know how to cook pasta.`
   - Explanation: The correct form is "She doesn't" (She does not), not "She don't."
8. Correct Sentence: `The dog wagged its tail.`
   - Explanation: The possessive form "its" is appropriate here, not "it's" (it is).
9. Correct Sentence: `I feel bad about forgetting your birthday.`
   - Explanation: "Badly" is an adverb and used to modify verbs, not feelings. Therefore, "bad" is correct.
10. Correct Sentence: `It's an easy job to do.`
   - Explanation: The contraction "It's" (it is) is appropriate here, not "Its" (possessive form). Also, use "an" before words that start with a vowel sound, like "easy."
